# Eclipse for Teaching Requirements and Systems Engineering

Requirements Management and Engineering (RE&M) is taught, both in industry and academia. The availability of open source RE-tools, and the RMF-based fmStudio in particular, created some interest for using those tools for teaching.

## Vision

Create (1) a set of teaching materials that is actively used; (2) which is embedded in a larger SE context; and (3) which explicitly focuses on applying RE.

Michael Jastram and Andrea Herrmann spoke [about this project at EclipseCon Europe 2014](https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2014/session/eclipse-teaching-systems-engineering-35-minute-standard-talk).</br>

## Scope

The scope is the creation of teaching materials, centered around a case study, based on existing methods and tools. The elements are:

* **Method:** We use [ISO 29110](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_29110) as the foundation, which is a standard specifically for small organizations and teams.
* **Tools:** We use an Eclipse-based toolchain.  The first component (for requiremeents engineering) is [ProR](https://www.eclipse.org/rmf/).
* **Case Study:** The case study will be the development of an autonomous rover.
* **Teaching Materials:** The teaching materials will be collected in [this gitHub project](https://github.com/jastram/teaching), available under the Apache 2.0 License.

## Objectives

*    **Collaboration of Industry, Service Providers and Academia:** These three groups can benefit vastly from each other: Industry relies on academia for skilled labor, while service provider deliver expertise to industry in the form of knowledge (consultants) and tools (vendors).
*    **Standardization of basic RE (or SE) skills:** Preparation of students with a basic set of skills that is relevant in industry, so employers know what to expect.
*    **Teaching Materials:** Ideally, one outcome of this effort is a set of adaptable teaching materials. 

Initially, we will focus on teaching materials, specifically a case study.
